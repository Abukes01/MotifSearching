# Motif Searching
***
This repository contains algorithms used for searching motifs in DNA sequences. Currently, 4 methods are available for motif searching across the modules, and module Motifs_Definitions.py is used to define outputs of other functions.
___
Algorithms are based on pseudocodes viewed in Chapter 2 of _Bioinformatics Algorithms - An Active Learning Approaach 2nd Edition, Vol. I_ by Phillip Compeau and Pavel Pevzner

The code for the moment lacks proper documentation, this will be worked on in the near future.
### A very important thing to take note of:
**The MedianString method is extremely time-consuming for large sets of data, and can take days to complete. I'm working on parallelization or GPU acceleration of all the methods in a separate branch of this project, and further algorithm optimisation.**

You are free and welcome to download and tamper with the modules for your own use.
